    <h2><span class="AboutMeHeading">Fabiana Garrido</span></h2>
    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p class="justify">A little about me is that I was actually born in San Cristobal, Venezuela. I lived in Venezuela
        until I was eight years old! However, due to the humanitarian crisis that was, and still continues to go on in
        Venezuela, my family decided to move to the US. I have lived here in Utah ever since, and have been living here
        now for 10 years! It is truly a priviledge to be able to have lived both in Venezuela and the US. I am very
        grateful! In this page, I would like to share about some of the things that inspire me and make me the person I
        am today</p>

    <h2 class="AboutMeHeading">Playing The Bass</h2>
    <div class="container"> <img src="../assets/img/Fender-P-Bass-electric-guitar.webp" alt="Bass Picture"
        style="height: 500px; width: 730px; align-items: center;">
    </div>
   
    <br><br>
    <p>Playing the bass guitar is one the many pleasures that I indulge in. I love doing it. However, with how busy I
        am, I am not able to play it as often as I want to. One of the things that I really want to acheive in life is
        to be really good at playing the bass. I want to be able to excel at something that is not school and do
        something that actually has meaning!</p>
    <p>To learn more about the bass guitar and its history, I recommend <a
            href="https://www.mi.edu/in-the-know/history-bass-guitar-jazz-rock/" target="_blank"
            title="History of the Bass Guitar">this page!</a></p>

    <h2 class="AboutMeHeading">Listening to Music</h2>
    <div class="container"> <img src="../assets/img/music-listening-illustration-2019-billboard-1548.webp"
            alt="Listening to Music" style="height: 500px; width: 730px;">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <p>Listening to music is something I am doing literally 24/7. There is not a day that goes by that I do not listen
        to music. I believe that everyone should find the music that they enjoy in order for them to truly enjoy life. A
        life without music to me seems tasteless. It would be lacking some sort of meaning for me. Music is that
        important for me, and I truly believe that there is a reason for that. I try to incorporate into everything that
        I do in my life.</p>
    <p>To be able to dive in and find your style of music, I encourage you to make an account in Spotify! Here is the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/signup" target="_blank">link</a>

    <h2 class="AboutMeHeading">Watching Shows</h2>

    <br><br>
    <p>Watching TV is one of my favorite things to do when I have free time. I am truly able to destress so much just by
        sitting down, grabbing some snacks, and watching my shows. It is something that brings me true joy and makes me
        disconnect from the world. It takes me away from the stress of school and is able to bring things that I have
        read about, to life!</p>
